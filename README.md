# Tic-Tac-Toe-game

It seems like you're referring to the game "Tic Tac Toe"! Tic Tac Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic pencil-and-paper game played by two players. The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid, although variations with larger grids exist.

Players take turns marking a square with their designated symbol, usually either an "X" or an "O," with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all squares are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game is considered a draw.

Tic Tac Toe is often used as a simple example in computer science and artificial intelligence to demonstrate concepts such as game theory and algorithms. It's a straightforward yet entertaining game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
